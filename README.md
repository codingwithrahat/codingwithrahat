### Most Used Languages

![C Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%20Language-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)  
*C is the first programming language I learned and is the foundation of my understanding of programming. I gained a deep understanding of computer architecture and memory management through C.*

![C++ Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)  
*C++ is my go-to language for competitive programming (CP). I utilize C++ for solving data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems efficiently due to its rich Standard Template Library (STL) and performance optimization.*

![Java Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)  
*Java helped me dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It taught me the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are crucial for building scalable and maintainable software systems.*

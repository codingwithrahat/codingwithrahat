## Programming Languages I Use

- **C**  
  ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C-00599C?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)  
  C was my first programming language, and it laid the foundation for my journey into software development. I started learning programming through C and found it immensely useful in grasping core concepts such as memory management and low-level operations.

- **C++**  
  ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%2B%2B-00599C?style=flat&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white)  
  I use **C++** extensively for competitive programming, where efficiency and execution speed are paramount. Through C++, I learned and implemented various data structures and algorithms (DSA), which are fundamental in solving complex problems in competitions.

- **Java**  
  ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-007396?style=flat&logo=java&logoColor=white)  
  **Java** has been a key language in my development as a software engineer. It helped me learn **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and gave me the tools to build scalable applications. The language’s strong ecosystem and community support make it ideal for building robust systems and enterprise-level applications.
